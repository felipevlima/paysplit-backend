/**
 * @file ClientResponse is a module that standardizes the responses that
 * are sent to a client. The module assumes that the Express framework is
 * being used and it is therefore a requirement for the module to work. The
 * main function returned from the module is used to modify an Express Request
 * object by setting up the status codes and using a JSON payload with a
 * standardized response. The messages sent back to the client can be overriden
 * with custom messages. It is also possible to send data back to the client.
 * All of the standardized messages are client safe, meaning they do not leak
 * information regarding what specifically went wrong in the case of an error.
 * Remember that all messages, standard and custom, are easily viewable by the
 * client and therefore it would be unwise to send anything you would not want
 * the client to see.

/**
 * @description Takes an Express response object, an http status code, as well
 * as optional custom messages and data. Using these parameters, it returns
 * a formatted Express response with a JSON payload configured with the optional
 * parameters. This function is useful for standardizing API responses.
 * @param {Express.Response} res An Express Response object
 * @param {number} code An HTTP Status Code
 * @param {Array<String>=} messages
 * An optional array of strings to replace the default ones provided by the
 * StatusMessages object.
 * @param {any=} data
 * Any data that may need to be sent to the client. This is left intentionally
 * as open as possible so that it can be very versatile. An example might be
 * returning a JWT to the user under the data heading.
 * @returns {Express.Response} The modified response object.
 * @example <caption>Example showing basic usage with defaults</caption>
 * router.get('/', (req, res) => {
 *  return respondWith(res, 200);
 * });
 *
 * // The returned json payload to the user:
 * {
 *  status: "Success",
 *  messages: [
 *    "Request succeeded."
 *  ]
 * }
 * @example <caption>Example overriding defaults</caption>
 * router.post('/user', (req, res) => {
 *  const user = new User(req.body);
